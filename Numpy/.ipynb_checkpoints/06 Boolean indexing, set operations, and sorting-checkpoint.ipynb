    "Up oto now we have seen how to make slices and select elements of an ndarray sing indices. This is useful when we know the exact indices of the elements we sant to select. hosever, there are many situations in which we don't know the indices of the elements we weant to select. For example, suppose we have a 10000 x 10000 ndarray of random integers ranging from 1 to 15000 and we only want to select those integers that are less than 20.Boolean indexig can help us in these cases, by allowing us select elements unsing logical arguments instead of explicit indices. Let's see some examples. \n",
