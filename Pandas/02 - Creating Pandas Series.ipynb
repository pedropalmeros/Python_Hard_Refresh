    "\n",
    "## Difference between Numpy ndarrays and Pandas Series\n",
    "1. One of the main differences betweeen Pandas Series and NumPy ndarrays is that you can assign an index label to each element in the Pandas Series. In other words, you can name the indices of your Pandas Series anything you want\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Another big difference between Pandas Series and NumPy ndarrays is that Pandas Series can hold data of different data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing Pandas into Python. It has become a convetnion to import Pandas as `pd`, therefore, you can import Pandas by typing the following command in your Jupyter notebook;\n"
