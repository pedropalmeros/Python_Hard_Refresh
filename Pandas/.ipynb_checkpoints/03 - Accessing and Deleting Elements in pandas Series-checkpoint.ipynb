    "Now let's look at how we can acess or modify elements in Pandas Series. One great advange on Pndas Series is that i allow us to access data in many different ways. Elements can be accessed using dindex labels or numerical indices inside square brackets, `[]`, similar to how we access elemenets in NumPy ndarrays. Since we can use numerical indices, we can use both positive and gegative integers to access data from the beginning or from the end of the Series, respectively. Since se can access elements in various ways, in order to remove any ambiguity to whether we are referring to an index label or numercial index, Pandas Series have two attributes, `.loc` and `.iloc` to explicity state what we mean. The attribute `.loc` stands for *location* and it is used to explicitly state that we are using a labeled index. Similarly, the attribute `.iloc` stands for *integer location* and it is used to explicitly state that we are using a numercial index. Let's see some examples: \n",
