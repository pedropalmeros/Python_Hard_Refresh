    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of your programs will ask users to input certain kinds of information. You might allow users to store preferences ina game or provide data for visualization. Whatever the focus of your program is, you'll store the information useres provide in data structures such as lists and dictionaries. When users close a program, you'll almost always want to save the information they entered. A simple way to do this involves storing your data using the `json` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `json` moduleallows you to dump simple Python data structures into a file and load the data from that file the next time the program runs. You can also use `json` to share data between different Python programs. Even better, the JSONdata format is not specific to Python, so you can share data you store in the JSON format with people who work in many other programming languages. It's useful and portable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: The JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) format was originally developed for JavaScript. However, it has since become a common format used by many languages, including Python**"
